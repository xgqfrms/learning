# Authentication & API Keys



Authentication & API Keys

Many APIs require an API key. Just as a real-world key allows you to access something, an API key grants you access to a particular API. Moreover, an API key identifies you to the API, which helps the API provider keep track of how their service is used and prevent unauthorized or malicious activity.

Some APIs require authentication using a protocol called OAuth. We won't get into the details, but if you've ever been redirected to a page asking for permission to link an application with your account, you've probably used OAuth.

API keys are often long alphanumeric strings. We've made one up in the editor to the right! (It won't actually work on anything, but when you receive your own API keys in future projects, they'll look a lot like this.)
