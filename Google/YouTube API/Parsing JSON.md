# Parsing JSON





JSON (which stands for Java Script Object Notation) is an alternative to XML. It gets its name from the fact that its data format resembles JavaScript objects, and it is often more succinct than the equivalent XML. For instance, our same <pet> Jeffrey would look like this in JSON:

{
    "pets": {
        "name": "Jeffrey",
        "species": "Giraffe"
    }
}

Look, ma! No tags!
